Prefer candles for your eurdora.\n\nThe arguments accepted by the script are listed below. Note that you can combine multiple options; for example "loopgyou pulls=18 tune=blender" will save 2 pulls and switch moon sign to Blender during the run. Most options also have an associated setting to set an option permanently; for example "set loopgyou_pulls=18" will cause the script to always save 2 pulls (unless overriden by using the pulls option at runtime).',
